      <p class="content">Crimeno was developed to help tackle the increasing recurring crimes in particular areas. A RESTful MERN stack app, centred around the Police and Google Maps API. Users can pinpoint a location where a crime was committed using google maps markers. Other users will then be made aware of these crimes if they search a route within that area of the crime. There is also a heatmap derived from the Police API that highlights the crime in areas.</p>

        <p class="content">In an agile  group  project, I created a RESTful MEAN stack app. Poober helps you find your nearest toilet in a fellow user’s humble abode. With a group of three, we created an app for users and owners. Owners were able to upload their toilets to the database. Users are able to then search for toilets in their area and request to use. I owned the Facebook Oauth journey, implementing the filestack API, creating the user profile and implementing filtering.</p>

          <p>I built a game applying HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to create Roulette with a twist. There are three rounds with each getting harder incrementally. Also created a wallet and the ability to add fake chips. The most complicated part was the roulette wheel, getting it to spin and end on a random number.</p>

            <p>Inspired by friends and myself always asking whether something looks “OK”. I created a voting system fashion Express app using EJS with a Mongo database. Users were able to create and edit their profile, follow and unfollow users. Upload a photo using the Filestack API and comment on photos.</p>
